Description
================================================================================
The GPS Format allows e-learning content to be displayed according to the geo coordinates of the learner. 
This enables location-based mobile learning.
 
In events like a city rally, the learner walks between predefined locations using a smartphone or a tablet. 
At these stations the learner gets certain information and tasks that are directly related to the location.
All conceivable Moodle content like text, pictures, videos or tests can be used. 
The trainer is able to integrate new content at his desktop PC, by simply 
creating a new Moodle course.
The GPS format largely matches the popular topics 
format. 
Every topic section can contain different material or activities. 
In a 
second step specific topic sections can be assigned to the corresponding GPS 
coordinates where they should be visible. 
After the installation of the course 
format "GPS Format", 
Moodle courses can be created in the new format and 
existing courses can be transferred into the new format with only one click.
